tf-mips
========

About
-----
This project implements a simple pipeline CPU with TensorFlow, which ISA is subset of MIPS â… .
The purposes for this implementations is studying tensorflow as a dataflow programming.
As the result, achieved to running a infinite counting program compiled GCC C compiler.

Features of the techniques are:

* Register is implemented with tf.Variable
* Pipeline stages are described from downstream in order to forwarding wires to up stages.
* Next states of registers are temporary save to new variables and copy to actual registers to
synchronize.
